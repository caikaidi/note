**Wavefront:** in physics, a wavefront is the locus of point characterized by propagation of positions of identical phase

Microscope -> telescope -> ophthalmology(1978)

Adaptive optics (AO)

Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor

principle of AO:

- the first step: measuring an incoming wavefront by a wavefront sensor
- the second step: correcting the deformations of an incoming wavefront by deforming a mirror

Three types of aberration measurement devices:

1. The thin-beam ray-tracing aberrometer
2. The Tscherning aberrometer
3. Shark-Hartmann method

the laser

> **A laser** is a device that generates or amplifies coherent radiation at frequencies in the infrared, visible, or ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, then emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of eletromagnetic radiation.

Essential elements of a laser:

- a laser medium
- a pumping process
- Suitable optical feedback elements

Pumping can be *a eletrical current* or *a light at a different wavelength*

Femtosecond  10^-15 s

**femtosecond laser** is a laser in which the pulse duration is in femtosecond range

Nd: glass	 Nd: YAG

Solid-state laser 	typically optically pumped: a glass lamp or laser diodes

a femtosecond laser has a few basic elements :

- a broadband gain medium
- a laser cavity
- an output coupler
- a dispersie element
- a phase modulator
- a gain/loss process controlled by the pulse intensity or energy

Laser tissue interactions

Structure of the cornea

Cornea accounts for two-thirds of the total refractive power

*smoothness of the corneal surface* & *total thickness of the cornea* lead to visual distortion

11 to 12mm horizontally and 9 to 11mm vertically and 0.5mm thick at the center

the optical properties of the cornea are determined by its transparency, surface smoothness,  contour, refractive index
