**Wavefront:** in physics, a wavefront is the locus of point characterized by propagation of positions of identical phase

Microscope -> telescope -> ophthalmology(1978)

Adaptive optics (AO)

Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor

principle of AO:

- the first step: measuring an incoming wavefront by a wavefront sensor
- the second step: correcting the deformations of an incoming wavefront by deforming a mirror

Three types of aberration measurement devices:

1. The thin-beam ray-tracing aberrometer
2. The Tscherning aberrometer
3. Shark-Hartmann method

the laser

> **A laser** is a device that generates or amplifies coherent radiation at frequencies in the infrared, visible, or ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, then emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of eletromagnetic radiation.

Essential elements of a laser:

- a laser medium
- a pumping process
- Suitable optical feedback elements

Pumping can be *a eletrical current* or *a light at a different wavelength*

Femtosecond  10^-15 s

**femtosecond laser** is a laser in which the pulse duration is in femtosecond range

Nd: glass	 Nd: YAG

Solid-state laser 	typically optically pumped: a glass lamp or laser diodes

a femtosecond laser has a few basic elements :

- a broadband gain medium
- a laser cavity
- an output coupler
- a dispersie element
- a phase modulator
- a gain/loss process controlled by the pulse intensity or energy

Laser tissue interactions

Structure of the cornea

Cornea accounts for two-thirds of the total refractive power

*smoothness of the corneal surface* & *total thickness of the cornea* lead to visual distortion

11 to 12mm horizontally and 9 to 11mm vertically and 0.5mm thick at the center

the optical properties of the cornea are determined by its transparency, surface smoothness,  contour, refractive index

Epithelium, Bowman's layer, storma(90%), Descement's membrane, endothelium

#### 1.3.2 physical principles of laser tissue interactions

a common finding is that the short pulse damage is deterministic in nature and the threshold is lower with shorter laser pulses

Laser tissue interactions: 

- Photochemical interactions
- thermal interactions
- Photo ablation
- Plasma induced ablation (femtosecond laser flap)(also called plasma mediated ablation)
- Photo disruption

a single parameter distinguishes and primarily controls these process: the duration of laser exposure

Laser induced optical breakdown (LIOB) 10^11 w/cm^2 in solids or fluids 10^14 w/cm^2 in air
$$
I(r,z,t)=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0CE^2
$$
Q switched pulses: nanosecond

- First step
  - first you get the *thermionic emission*
  - from this one we get the *multiphoton ionization*
  - Both two above get a few elections initiate on avalanche effect
  - leading to the accumulation of free electrons
- second step
  - Accelerated electron absorbs a photon and accelerates: two free electrons
- third step
  - the two free electrons absorb accelerate two more
  - This step continued so more and more electrions were produced

Mode locked pulses: picosecond or femtosecond

a common finding: laser intensity is inversely proportional to laser pulse duration, namely laser breakdown thresholds decrease by the square root of the pulse duration over loofs to 100 ms

an optimal pulse duration for femtosecond laser corneal surgery in the few hundreds of femtosecond pulse duration ranges

### 2. LASIK surgery

### 2.1 LASIK procedure

LASIK is laser in situ keratomileusis.

as of 2011 over 11 million LASIK in US, 1million every year in US.

as of 2009 over 28 million in the whole world.

LASIK procedure consist two steps:

- a thin flap is created on the anterior surface of the cornea and lifted
- The underlying corneal stroma is ablated and then the flap is replaced

the layers of tissue removed are tens of micrometers thick

### 2.2 All solid state chirped pulse amplification(CPA) femtosecond laser

fs -> ps -> amplify -> fs

1. stretched out in time prior to introducing it to the amplifier
   - the low frequency component of the laser pulse travels a shorter path than the high high frequency component does, which is called group velocity dispersion(GVD).
2. Amplify
3. Recompressed back

GVD: prisms, or gratings, or GTI mirrors

laser come out from the fs laser oscillator: 76MHz  1nJ  <200fs

after CPA: 1KHz  5uJ  800fs

### 2.3 femtosecond laser assisted flap creation

before we use femtosecond laser, we use *microkeratome*: blade guality gap width of the microkeratome head, translation speed affert guality of the flap

advantages of femtosecond laser:

- primarly due to the enhanced precision and minimized collateral tissue effects.
- Greater accuracy in flap size, shape and thickness.

IntraLASIK and femtoLASIK are all laserLASIK
