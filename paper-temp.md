It is generally believed in China that Nicolaus Copernicus, who put forward the heliocentrism, was burned to death by the church. In this lecture I searched some materials and found it incorrect.

Acturally Copernicus is a very catious man that he didn't agree to publish his  book *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium* untill the last few years of his life. He had formulated his theory by 1510, and the book was published in 1543. At that time you can never published a book against the church, the publish of  *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium* was benefit from a preacher called Andreas Osiander. In order to reduce the controversial impact of the book, he added his own unsigned letter printed in front of the book. Osiander's letter stated that Copernicus' system was mathematics intended to aid computation and not an attempt to declare literal truth. Besides, Copernicus said  that his book was written for Paulus PP. III, he hopes that his book could be published under the protect of the pope.

Copernicus just died when he saw his book, and his book is rarely noticed by people. And after half a century, a priest of Dominican Order called Giordano Bruno spreaded the heliocentrism over the general people, which made the church banned Copernicus' book in 1616.
